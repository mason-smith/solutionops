      Welcome to the former site of <span class="text-gradient">SolutionOps</span>
    </h1>
    <p>Some years ago I decided to leave the independent contracting life behind me and pursue full time employment.</p>
    <p>
      I am now happily employed at <a class="text-gradient" href="https://backboneplm.com/" target="_blank"
        >Backbone PLM</a
      > where I deep dive into the more esoteric and specialized issues we encounter.
    </p>

    <p>
      I am not active on social media but you can scope some half-finished side projects and experiments on my <a
        class="text-gradient"
        href="https://github.com/mason-smith"
        target="_blank">Github</a
      >.
    </p>

    <p>
      I have a "blog" called <a class="text-gradient" href="https://masonsmith.dev/" target="_blank">WeirdJS</a> where I
      just kind of say what's on my mind. <br />Don't visit that link yet though. It is currently under construction and
      the content is half finished garbage at the moment.
